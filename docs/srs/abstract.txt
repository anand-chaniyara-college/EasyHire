1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document presents a comprehensive abstract for the Recruitment and Interview 
Management System (EasyHire), a web-based enterprise application designed to 
streamline and automate the end-to-end hiring process for organizations. The 
system was developed as a collaborative project by a 3-member team over a 
2-month development cycle, demonstrating professional-grade software engineering 
practices.
