Weekly Progress Report
Name: Anand
Role: Backend Developer & Database Designer
Week: 5 (Jan 26 - Feb 5)

Task Completed:

1. Requirements & Planning (Pre-dev):
   - Met with the team to finalize the "EasyHire" features.
   - Wrote the SRS document drafts to define what we are actually building.
   - Selected the Tech Stack: Decided to use Spring Boot because it covers Security and Web easily.

2. Database Design & Setup:
   - Designed the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the entire system (See SRS Document).
   - Decided the table structures for Users, Departments, Positions, and Vacancies.
   - Wrote the SQL script to create these tables and shared it with the team.
   - Set up the relationships (Foreign Keys) to make sure data is consistent.

3. Project Initialization:
   - Created the Spring Boot project and added dependencies (Web, JPA, Security).
   - Connected the application to the MySQL database I designed.
   - Organized the project folder structure (Controllers, Services).

4. User Module Backend:
   - Wrote the User Entity class matching the database table.
   - Implemented the Registration Logic (checking for duplicate emails).
   - Used BCrypt to encrypt passwords for security.

5. Department & Position Management:
   - Wrote the code to Add, Update, and Delete Departments.
   - Wrote the code to functionality to manage Job Positions.
   - Linked Positions to Departments (e.g., "Software Engineer" belongs to "IT Department").
   - Tested all these features manually to make sure they work before giving them to the frontend team.

Plan for Next Week:
- I need to link the Candidates to the Job Vacancies in the database.
- Will write the logic to handle file uploads for CVs.
- Need to ensure only active jobs can accept applications.
