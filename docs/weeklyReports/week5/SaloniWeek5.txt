Weekly Report: Saloni (Frontend Developer)
Week: 5 (Jan 26 - Feb 5)
Project: EasyHire

Work Done:

1. UX Planning & Design:
   - Sketched the wireframes on paper to visualize how the Dashboard will look.
   - Selected the Color Palette (Blue & White professional theme) and Fonts.
   - Planned the User Journey: How a user goes from Login -> Dashboard -> Job Posting.

2. Design & Layouts:
   - Built the "Master Layout" for the website. This includes the Sidebar and the Top Header.
   - Made sure the sidebar collapses on small screens (mobile friendly).
   - Designed a standard Footer to show on every page.
   - Picked the color theme and fonts for the whole application.

3. Login & Authentication Screens:
   - Designed the Login Page with a modern look.
   - Added checks (Validation) to make sure users don't leave fields empty.
   - Added "Pop-up Alerts" that show up if the password is wrong.
   - Designed the "Forgot Password" flow so users can recover accounts.

4. Dashboard & User Management:
   - Designed the main Admin Dashboard page layout.
   - Created the "System Users" page:
     - It shows a list of all users in a neat table.
     - Added "Active/Inactive" status badges.
   - Designed the "Add New User" pop-up form so Admin can add people easily without leaving the page.

5. FoEasyHire for Data Entry:
   - Designed the foEasyHire for "Add Department" and "Add Position".
   - Started working on the "Create Job" form. It's a big form, so I organized it into sections like "Basic Info" and "Salary Details" to make it easy to fill.

Plan for Next Week:
- I will build the "Careers Page" for public applicants.
- Need to design the long "Job Application" form.
- Will work on the candidate list view for HR.
