Weekly Progress Report
Name: Anand
Role: Backend Developer
Week: 6 (Feb 6 - Feb 24)

Tasks Completed:

1. Vacancy Module:
   - Wrote the logic to Publish, Close, and Reopen job vacancies.
   - Added validations: For example, ensuring a job cannot be closed if it has interviews scheduled today.
   - Tested the status updates using Postman.

2. Application Process:
   - Created the 'Candidate' Entity.
   - Wrote the main API where the Frontend sends the candidate data and we save it.
   - Mapped the Candidate to the specific Vacancy (Foreign Key) automatically.
   - Handled the file upload logic using `StandardServletMultipartResolver`. We are saving files with a unique name to avoid conflicts.

3. Search & Filters:
   - Wrote a complex JPQL query to filter candidates.
   - HR can now search candidates by "Skill", "Experience", or "Status".
   - It was returning duplicate results initially, so I added `DISTINCT` to the query to fix it.

Next Week Plan:
- Interview Scheduling logic (It seems complex).
- Candidate Status Workflow.
- Sending email acknowledgments.
