Weekly Progress Report
Name: Krish
Role: DevOps Engineer
Week: 6 (Feb 6 - Feb 24)

Tasks Accomplished:

1. File Storage Infrastructure:
   - Configured a local directory outside the project folder to store uploaded CVs (for security).
   - Configured the resource handler in Spring MVC (`WebMvcConfig`) so that only logged-in HRs can access these files via a specific URL.
   - Tested uploading a 10MB file to check if the limit works (It rejected it as expected).

2. Database Optimization:
   - Noticed the search query was slow when I inserted 1000 dummy records.
   - Analyzed the query and added an Index on `skills` and `status` columns in the database.
   - Query time dropped from 200ms to 15ms.

3. Email Server Setup:
   - Configured the `application.properties` with the Gmail SMTP settings.
   - Created a temporary 'App Password' in Google Account for testing.
   - Wrote an Async service, so sending an email happens in the background and doesn't freeze the UI.

Next Week:
- Real-time notifications (WebSockets).
- HTML Templates for Database.
- Logging and Notification storage.
