Weekly Progress Report
Name: Saloni
Role: Frontend Developer
Week: 6 (Feb 6 - Feb 24)

Work Done:

1. Public Career Page:
   - Designed the "Careers" page for visitors.
   - Used Bootstrap Cards to display jobs heavily.
   - Added a Department Filter at the top (e.g., Show only "IT" jobs).

2. Job Application Form:
   - This was a big form. I split it into multiple steps (Personal Info -> Education -> Upload).
   - Added a File Input for the Resume.
   - Used JavaScript to show a "Uploading..." progress text so the user knows something is happening.
   - Added a check: If someone enters an email that already applied, we show a red warning instantly.

3. HR Candidate View:
   - Built the page where HR sees all applicants.
   - Integrated 'DataTables' jQuery plugin. It gives us Search and Sorting for free.
   - Designed a "Quick Preview" modal. When HR clicks an eye icon, a small popup shows the resume summary.

Next Week:
- Design the Interview Scheduler (calender view).
- Candidate Profile page.
- Email Template UI.
