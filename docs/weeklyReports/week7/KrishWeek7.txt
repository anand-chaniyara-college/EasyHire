Weekly Progress Report
Name: Krish
Role: DevOps Engineer
Week: 7 (Feb 25 - Mar 10)

Tasks Accomplished:

1. WebSockets (Notifications):
   - Configured the STOMP endpoint for real-time messaging.
   - Implemented the "Push Notification" logic.
   - Tested it by opening the app in two different browsers (Chrome and Firefox) to see if the message appears instantly. It works!

2. Email Templates:
   - Designed responsive HTML templates for emails using tables (old school, but works best for email clients).
   - Added placeholders like `{{candidate_name}}` and `{{interview_time}}`.
   - Used Thymeleaf's `Context` to replace these placeholders dynamically in the backend.

3. Integration Testing:
   - Tested the flow: Application Submitted -> Notification appears on HR Dashboard -> Email sent to candidate.
   - Fixed a small issue where the WebSocket connection dropped after 10 minutes of inactivity.

Next Week:
- JasperReports integration.
- Unit Testing with JUnit.
- Dockerizing the app.
