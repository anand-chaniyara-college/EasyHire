Weekly Progress Report
Name: Saloni
Role: Frontend Developer
Week: 7 (Feb 25 - Mar 10)

Work Done:

1. Scheduling UI:
   - Designed the "Schedule Interview" modal popup.
   - Integrated a "Date Time Picker" library because the default HTML date input looks bad.
   - Added a "Multi-select" dropdown to choose 3-4 interviewers at once.

2. Candidate Timeline:
   - Designed a vertical timeline on the Candidate Profile.
   - It visually shows the candidate's journey (Green dots for completed steps, Grey for future).
   - Added "Action Buttons" (Shortlist, Reject) at the top of the profile for easy access.

3. Email Composer:
   - Built the "Send Email" page.
   - It allows HR to select a template (e.g., "Interview Invite").
   - shows a preview of the email with the candidate's name filled in.
   - Verified that the "Send" button gets disabled after clicking once (to prevent double emails).

Next Week:
- Dashboard Charts (Chart.js).
- Report Download page.
- Dark Mode toggle.
