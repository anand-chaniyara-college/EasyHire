Weekly Progress Report
Name: Krish
Role: DevOps Engineer
Week: 8 (Mar 11 - Mar 18)

Tasks Accomplished:

1. Reporting Engine Setup:
   - Added the JasperReports library to `pom.xml`.
   - Designed the report layout (JRXML file) using Jaspersoft Studio.
   - Had some issues with fonts not appearing in Linux, so I embedded the fonts in the classpath.

2. Testing:
   - Wrote JUnit tests for the `UserService` and `VacancyService`.
   - Added Mockito to mock the database calls so tests run fast.
   - Achieved about 60% code coverage on the core services.

3. Docker Draft:
   - Wrote the initial `Dockerfile`.
   - Used `openjdk:17-alpine` to keep the image size small.
   - Created a `docker-compose` file to launch the App and MySQL together.

Next Week:
- Production environment setup.
- Optimize queries for bulk actions.
- Finals slides.
