Weekly Progress Report
Name: Anand
Role: Backend Developer
Week: 9 (Mar 19 - Apr 02)

Tasks Completed:

1. AI Scoring (Enhancement):
   - Implemented a keyword matching service.
   - It splits the Resume text and compares it with Job Requirements.
   - Calculates a simple score (0-100) and saves it in the database.

2. Bulk Actions:
   - Wrote an API to handle valid list of IDs.
   - Can now "Reject" or "Shortlist" 50 candidates in one click.
   - Used `@Transactional` to make sure if one fails, all are rolled back.

3. Cleanup:
   - Refactored the `EmailService` to handle bulk sending (using a loop with a small delay to be safe).
   - Removed some old unused controllers.

Next Week:
- Final Bug fixes.
- API Documentation.
- Code handover.
