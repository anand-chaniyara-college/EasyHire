Weekly Progress Report
Name: Krish
Role: DevOps Engineer
Week: 9 (Mar 19 - Apr 02)

Tasks Accomplished:

1. Production Optimization:
   - The Bulk Action was causing slow loading. I analyzed the logs.
   - Increased the database connection pool size in `application.properties`.
   - Added an index on the `ai_match_score` column since we filter by it now.

2. Staging Setup:
   - Set up a complete local environment that mimics the presentation PC.
   - Configured self-signed HTTPS certificates (just for demo purposes to show we know how SSL works).

3. Stress Testing:
   - Tried sending 500 emails at once. The server held up fine.
   - Monitored memory usage using VisualVM during the test.

Next Week:
- Finalize Docker images.
- Presentation Slides.
- Burn code to CD/USB.
